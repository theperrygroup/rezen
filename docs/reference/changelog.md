# Changelog

All notable changes to the ReZEN Python client will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.5] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **Transaction Builder**: Updated `dealType` field value from "COMPENSATING" to "SALE" in all documentation, examples, and tests. The API returns 500 errors when using "COMPENSATING" or "NON_COMPENSATING" values on transaction submission, but accepts "SALE" successfully. This fix prevents submission failures caused by incorrect dealType values.
- **Documentation**: Updated all code examples and guides to use the correct dealType value
- **Examples**: Fixed working examples to use dealType: "SALE" instead of deprecated values
- **Style Guide**: Added section documenting known API field value issues to prevent future problems

## [2.2.4] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **Code Quality**: Minor formatting improvements to test files

## [2.2.3] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **Transaction Builder**: Fixed `add_participant` method to correctly send multipart/form-data instead of JSON. The method now properly converts participant data to the files format to ensure compatibility with the API's multipart/form-data requirement.
- **Documentation**: Updated `add_commission_payer` method documentation to include all required fields (firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber, companyName) that were previously undocumented but necessary for successful API calls.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-08

### Added
- **Users API**: Complete implementation for user profile access, team membership, and office details
- **Owner Agent Support**: Enhanced Transaction Builder with owner agent functionality requiring proper transaction sequence
- **Keymaker Integration**: Access agent IDs through user keymaker endpoint for transaction operations
- **Convenience Methods**: `set_current_user_as_owner_agent()` for simplified owner agent setup
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: New exception types for better developer experience:
  - `InvalidFieldNameError`: Catches incorrect field names (e.g., `address` vs `street`)
  - `InvalidFieldValueError`: Validates field formats (e.g., uppercase state codes)
  - `TransactionSequenceError`: Identifies when operations are called in wrong order
- **Field Validation**: Pre-API validation for common field name and format errors

### Changed
- **Transaction Builder**: Owner agent endpoint now requires specific setup sequence (location → price/date → clients → owner agent)
- **API Coverage**: Total endpoints increased from 155 to 158 with the addition of Users API
- **Error Messages**: More descriptive error messages with specific field correction suggestions
- **Validation**: Methods now validate field names and values before making API calls

### Fixed
- **Owner Agent**: Discovered and documented the required transaction setup sequence for successful owner agent addition
- **Field Name Validation**: Methods now prevent common field name mistakes before API calls
- **Commission Endpoints**: Multipart/form-data handling for commission payer endpoint
