## 🚨 **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS** - Read This First!

!!! danger "API Requirements That Must Be Followed"

    Based on extensive testing, these requirements are **MANDATORY** for successful API calls. Failing to follow them will result in "Bad request: Invalid request" errors.

### 🏠 Location Updates

**❌ THIS FAILS:**
```python
# Basic address fields alone will FAIL
location_data = {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Salt Lake City", 
    "state": "UTAH",
    "zip": "84101"
}
# API returns: "Bad request: Invalid request"
```

**✅ THIS WORKS:**
```python
# Additional property details are REQUIRED
location_data = {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Salt Lake City",
    "state": "UTAH", 
    "zip": "84101",
    "county": "Salt Lake",      # REQUIRED
    "yearBuilt": 2020,         # REQUIRED  
    "mlsNumber": "MLS123456"   # REQUIRED
}
```

### 💰 Price/Date Updates

**❌ THIS FAILS:**
```python
# Basic price fields alone will FAIL
price_data = {
    "dealType": "COMPENSATING",
    "propertyType": "RESIDENTIAL",
    "salePrice": {"amount": 500000, "currency": "USD"},
    "representationType": "BUYER"
}
# API returns: "Bad request: Invalid request"
```

**✅ THIS WORKS:**
```python
# BOTH commission objects are REQUIRED
price_data = {
    "dealType": "COMPENSATING",
    "propertyType": "RESIDENTIAL", 
    "salePrice": {"amount": 500000, "currency": "USD"},
    "representationType": "BUYER",
    "listingCommission": {     # REQUIRED
        "commissionPercent": 3.0,
        "percentEnabled": True,
        "negativeOrEmpty": False
    },
    "saleCommission": {        # REQUIRED
        "commissionPercent": 3.0,
        "percentEnabled": True,
        "negativeOrEmpty": False
    }
}
```

### 👥 Co-Agent Roles

**✅ WORKING ROLES:**
- `"REAL"` - Always works
- `"BUYERS_AGENT"` - Works with location data
- `"SELLERS_AGENT"` - Works with location data

**❌ NON-WORKING ROLES:**
- `"LISTING_AGENT"` - Always fails

### 🏢 Owner Agent Requirements

Owner agents require a **specific sequence** and additional fields:

1. Create transaction
2. Add location info (with additional fields) - **REQUIRED FIRST**
3. Add price/date info (with commission objects) - **REQUIRED SECOND**  
4. Add buyers/sellers - **REQUIRED THIRD**
5. **THEN** add owner agent (with valid `officeId` and `teamId`)

## 🏗️ Transaction Lifecycle Overview

Real estate transactions in ReZEN follow a structured lifecycle:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create Builder] --> B[Add Participants]
    B --> C[Set Property Info]
    C --> D[Configure Finances]
    D --> E[Submit Transaction]
    E --> F[Manage Live Transaction]
    F --> G[Process Payments]
    G --> H[Generate Documents]
    H --> I[Close Transaction]
```

## 👥 Handling Multiple Teams

Many users belong to multiple teams in ReZEN. This section shows how to handle team selection when creating transactions.

!!! info "Team Selection in ReZEN"

    When adding an owner agent to a transaction, you must specify:
    - **Agent ID**: Your user ID (automatically retrieved)
    - **Office ID**: Your office ID (automatically retrieved) 
    - **Team ID**: Which team to use (requires selection if multiple)

### 🔍 Discovering Available Teams

First, check what teams and offices you have access to:

```python
from rezen import RezenClient

def check_user_teams():
    """Check what teams the current user belongs to."""
    client = RezenClient()
    
    # Get comprehensive team and office information
    teams_info = client.transaction_builder.get_user_teams_and_offices()
    
    print(f"Agent ID: {teams_info['agent_id']}")
    print(f"Office ID: {teams_info['office_id']}")
    print(f"Has multiple teams: {teams_info['has_multiple_teams']}")
    
    if teams_info["has_multiple_teams"]:
        print(f"\n🏢 You belong to {len(teams_info['teams'])} teams:")
        for team in teams_info["teams"]:
            is_default = team["id"] == teams_info["default_team"]["id"]
            marker = " ⭐ (DEFAULT)" if is_default else ""
            print(f"  - {team['name']}")
            print(f"    Role: {team['role']}")
            print(f"    ID: {team['id']}{marker}")
        
        print(f"\n🎯 Smart default team: {teams_info['default_team']['name']}")
        print("   (Prefers LEADER role over ADMIN)")
    else:
        print(f"\n🏢 Single team: {teams_info['default_team']['name']}")
    
    return teams_info

# Example output:
# Agent ID: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
# Office ID: 87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321
# Has multiple teams: True
# 
# 🏢 You belong to 2 teams:
#   - The Perry Group Standard Team
#     Role: LEADER
#     ID: team-uuid-1 ⭐ (DEFAULT)
#   - The Perry Group Marketing Group  
#     Role: ADMIN
#     ID: team-uuid-2
#
# 🎯 Smart default team: The Perry Group Standard Team
#    (Prefers LEADER role over ADMIN)
```

### 🚀 Three Approaches to Owner Agent Setup

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:

=== "Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)"

    Use the default team with smart selection logic:

    ```python
    def setup_owner_agent_automatic():
        """Use automatic team selection (prefers LEADER role)."""
        client = RezenClient()
        
        # Create and setup transaction
        transaction_id = create_basic_transaction()
        
        # Set current user as owner agent with default team
        result = client.transaction_builder.set_current_user_as_owner_agent(
            transaction_id, 
            role="BUYERS_AGENT"  # or "SELLERS_AGENT"
        )
        
        print("✅ Owner agent set with default team")
        return result
    
    # This method:
    # - Uses smart default logic (LEADER > ADMIN > first team)
    # - Shows warning if you have multiple teams
    # - Handles all ID resolution automatically
    ```

=== "Option 2: Discovery + Selection"

    Check teams first, then choose explicitly:

    ```python
    def setup_owner_agent_with_choice():
        """Check teams and choose which one to use."""
        client = RezenClient()
        
        # Create transaction
        transaction_id = create_basic_transaction()
        
        # Discover available teams
        teams_info = client.transaction_builder.get_user_teams_and_offices()
        
        if teams_info["has_multiple_teams"]:
            print("Available teams:")
            for i, team in enumerate(teams_info["teams"]):
                role = team["role"]
                name = team["name"]
                is_default = team["id"] == teams_info["default_team"]["id"]
                marker = " (DEFAULT)" if is_default else ""
                print(f"  {i+1}. {name} - Role: {role}{marker}")
            
            # For demo, use default team  
            # In real app, you might prompt user for choice
            selected_team_id = teams_info["default_team"]["id"]
            print(f"Using: {teams_info['default_team']['name']}")
        else:
            selected_team_id = teams_info["default_team"]["id"]
            print(f"Using single team: {teams_info['default_team']['name']}")
        
        # Set owner agent with specific team
        result = client.transaction_builder.set_current_user_as_owner_agent_with_team(
            transaction_id,
            role="BUYERS_AGENT",
            team_id=selected_team_id
        )
        
        print("✅ Owner agent set with chosen team")
        return result
    ```

=== "Option 3: Always Explicit"

    Always specify the team ID directly:

    ```python
    def setup_owner_agent_explicit():
        """Always specify team explicitly for full control."""
        client = RezenClient()
        
        # Create transaction
        transaction_id = create_basic_transaction()
        
        # Get available teams
        teams_info = client.transaction_builder.get_user_teams_and_offices()
        
        # Select team by business logic (e.g., always use LEADER team)
        leader_teams = [t for t in teams_info["teams"] if t["role"] == "LEADER"]
        
        if leader_teams:
            selected_team_id = leader_teams[0]["id"]
            print(f"Using LEADER team: {leader_teams[0]['name']}")
        else:
            # Fallback to default
            selected_team_id = teams_info["default_team"]["id"]
            print(f"No LEADER team, using default: {teams_info['default_team']['name']}")
        
        # Set owner agent with explicit team
        result = client.transaction_builder.set_current_user_as_owner_agent_with_team(
            transaction_id,
            role="BUYERS_AGENT", 
            team_id=selected_team_id
        )
        
        print("✅ Owner agent set with explicit team selection")
        return result
    ```

### ✅ Complete Working Example

Here's a full example that handles multiple teams automatically:

```python
def create_transaction_with_owner_agent():
    """Create complete transaction with owner agent handling multiple teams."""
    client = RezenClient()
    
    try:
        # Step 1: Create transaction
        transaction_id = client.transaction_builder.create_transaction_builder()
        print(f"Created transaction: {transaction_id}")
        
        # Step 2: Add location with ALL required fields
        location_data = {

        )
        print("✅ Set owner agent with automatic team handling")

## 🚀 Complete Transaction Workflow

### Phase 1: Transaction Creation

=== "Basic Transaction Setup"

    ```python
    from rezen import RezenClient
    from rezen.exceptions import RezenError

    def create_basic_transaction():
        """Create a basic transaction with correct field names."""
        client = RezenClient()

        try:
            # Step 1: Create transaction builder
            response = client.transaction_builder.create_transaction_builder()
            transaction_id = str(response)  # Extract ID as string
            print(f"✅ Created transaction: {transaction_id}")

            # Step 2: Add property information
            # ⚠️ CRITICAL: Basic address fields alone will FAIL!
            # The API requires additional property details for successful location updates
            location_data = {

## 🛠️ Best Practices

### Error Handling

!!! tip "Robust Error Handling"

    ```python
    from rezen.exceptions import ValidationError, NotFoundError

    def safe_transaction_operation(transaction_id: str):
        try:
            # Transaction operation
            result = client.transactions.get_transaction(transaction_id)
            return {"success": True, "data": result}

        except NotFoundError:
            return {
                "success": False,

### Data Validation

!!! warning "Always Validate Input"

    ```python

        current_status = transaction.get('status')

        print(f"Current Status: {milestones.get(current_status, current_status)}")
    ```

## ⚠️ Important Field Name Requirements

### Field Naming Conventions

The ReZEN API has specific field name requirements that must be followed exactly to avoid validation errors:

!!! danger "Critical Field Names"

    | Field Type | ❌ WRONG | ✅ CORRECT | Notes |
    |------------|----------|-----------|-------|
    | **Location** |
    | Street | `address` | `street` | Primary street address |
    | ZIP Code | `zipCode`, `zip_code` | `zip` | Must use 'zip' only |
    | State | `state: "ca"` | `state: "CALIFORNIA"` | **MUST BE ALL CAPS** |
    | **Contact Info** |
    | First Name | `first_name`, `firstname` | `firstName` | camelCase required |
    | Last Name | `last_name`, `lastname` | `lastName` | camelCase required |
    | Phone | `phone`, `phone_number` | `phoneNumber` | camelCase required |
    | **Financial** |
    | Sale Price | `salePrice: 500000` | `salePrice: {amount: 500000, currency: "USD"}` | Must be object |
    | Earnest Money | `earnest_money` | `earnestMoney` | camelCase required |
    | Down Payment | `down_payment` | `downPayment` | camelCase required |
    | Loan Amount | `loan_amount` | `loanAmount` | camelCase required |
    | **Dates** |
    | Contract Date | `contract_date` | `contractDate` | camelCase, format: YYYY-MM-DD |
    | Closing Date | `closing_date` | `closingDate` | camelCase, format: YYYY-MM-DD |
    | Acceptance Date | `acceptance_date` | `acceptanceDate` | camelCase, format: YYYY-MM-DD |

### Common Gotchas

!!! warning "Watch Out For These Issues"

    1. **State Names Must Be ALL CAPS**
       ```python
       # ❌ WRONG
       location_data = {"state": "Utah"}
       location_data = {"state": "ut"}
       location_data = {"state": "UT"}
       
       # ✅ CORRECT
       location_data = {"state": "UTAH"}
       location_data = {"state": "CALIFORNIA"}
       ```

    2. **Sale Price Must Be An Object**
       ```python
       # ❌ WRONG
       price_data = {"salePrice": 500000}
       
       # ✅ CORRECT
       price_data = {
           "salePrice": {
               "amount": 500000,
               "currency": "USD"
           }
       }
       ```

    3. **Co-Agents Can Be Added Anytime**
       ```python
       # Co-agents don't require specific sequence
       co_agent_info = {
           "agentId": "agent-uuid-here",
           "role": "REAL",  # May display as BUYERS_AGENT/SELLERS_AGENT
           "receivesInvoice": False
       }
       # Can be added immediately after transaction creation
       client.transaction_builder.add_co_agent(transaction_id, co_agent_info)
       ```

    4. **Owner Agents Require Specific Sequence**
       ```python
       # Owner agents MUST be added after:
       # 1. Location info
       # 2. Price/date info (with representationType)
       # 3. Buyers/sellers
       # THEN you can add owner agent
       ```

### Field Validation Helper

!!! tip "Use This Helper Function"

    ```python
    def validate_and_fix_field_names(data: dict) -> dict:
        """Helper to convert common field name mistakes."""
        field_mappings = {
            # Location fields
            "address": "street",
            "zipCode": "zip",
            "zip_code": "zip",
            
            # Name fields
            "first_name": "firstName",
            "last_name": "lastName",
            "phone": "phoneNumber",
            "phone_number": "phoneNumber",
            
            # Financial fields
            "earnest_money": "earnestMoney",
            "down_payment": "downPayment",
            "loan_amount": "loanAmount",
            
            # Date fields
            "contract_date": "contractDate",
            "closing_date": "closingDate",
            "acceptance_date": "acceptanceDate"
        }
        
        # Create new dict with corrected field names
        corrected = {}
        for key, value in data.items():
            new_key = field_mappings.get(key, key)
            corrected[new_key] = value
            
        # Fix state to uppercase if present
        if "state" in corrected and isinstance(corrected["state"], str):
            corrected["state"] = corrected["state"].upper()
            
        return corrected
    ```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting & API Testing Results**

This section documents comprehensive testing results to help you avoid common API errors and understand which methods work reliably.

### ✅ **Confirmed Working Methods**

#### **Core Operations**
- ✅ `create_transaction_builder()` - Always works
- ✅ `get_transaction_builder()` - Always works
- ✅ `delete_transaction_builder()` - Presumed working
- ✅ `create_listing_builder()` - Always works

#### **Location Operations** 
- ✅ `update_location_info()` - **Only with additional fields**
  - **Required:** `county`, `yearBuilt`, `mlsNumber` (beyond basic address)
  - **Field names:** `street` (not `address`), `zip` (not `zipCode`)
  - **State format:** ALL CAPS (e.g., "UTAH", "CALIFORNIA")

#### **Price/Date Operations**
- ✅ `update_price_and_date_info()` - **Only with both commission objects**
  - **Required:** BOTH `listingCommission` AND `saleCommission` 
  - **salePrice format:** `{"amount": 500000, "currency": "USD"}` (not simple number)

#### **Participant Operations**
- ✅ `add_buyer()` - Works on transactions with location data
- ✅ `add_seller()` - Works on transactions with location data
- ✅ `add_co_agent()` with specific roles:
  - ✅ `role: "REAL"` - Always works
  - ✅ `role: "BUYERS_AGENT"` - Works with location data
  - ✅ `role: "SELLERS_AGENT"` - Works with location data

### ❌ **Methods That Don't Work**

#### **Owner Agent Operations**
- ❌ `update_owner_agent_info()` - Requires valid `officeId` and `teamId`
  - **Error:** "Missing required field 'officeId'" or "Missing required field 'teamId'"
  - **Sequence:** Must follow exact order (location → price → participants → owner)

#### **Limited Co-Agent Roles**
- ❌ `add_co_agent()` with `role: "LISTING_AGENT"` - Always fails

#### **Service Provider Operations**
- ❌ Most service provider methods - Dependencies not fully tested

### ⚠️ **Common Error Patterns**

#### **"Bad request: Invalid request"**
This generic error typically means:

1. **Missing additional fields** in location updates
2. **Missing commission objects** in price/date updates  
3. **Invalid co-agent role** (e.g., "LISTING_AGENT")
4. **Wrong sequence** for owner agent operations

#### **"Missing required field 'X'"**
- **officeId/teamId:** Owner agent operations need valid UUIDs
- **Commission fields:** Price/date updates need both commission objects

#### **InvalidFieldNameError**
- Using `address` instead of `street`
- Using `zipCode` instead of `zip`
- Using snake_case instead of camelCase

#### **InvalidFieldValueError**
- State not in ALL CAPS
- salePrice as number instead of object
- Invalid representationType values

### 🛠️ **Debugging Checklist**

When transaction operations fail, check:

**For Location Updates:**
- [ ] Included `county` field
- [ ] Included `yearBuilt` field (number)
- [ ] Included `mlsNumber` field
- [ ] Used `street` not `address`
- [ ] Used `zip` not `zipCode`
- [ ] State is ALL CAPS

**For Price/Date Updates:**
- [ ] Included `listingCommission` object
- [ ] Included `saleCommission` object
- [ ] salePrice is object: `{"amount": X, "currency": "USD"}`
- [ ] Used camelCase for date fields

**For Co-Agents:**
- [ ] Using working role: "REAL", "BUYERS_AGENT", or "SELLERS_AGENT"
- [ ] Not using "LISTING_AGENT" role
- [ ] Valid agent UUID

**For Owner Agents:**
- [ ] Transaction has location data
- [ ] Transaction has price/date data  
- [ ] Transaction has participants (buyer/seller)
- [ ] Have valid `officeId` UUID
- [ ] Have valid `teamId` UUID
- [ ] Role matches representationType

### 📋 **Tested Working Sequence**

This sequence is confirmed to work for creating complete transactions:

```python
# 1. Create transaction
transaction_id = client.transaction_builder.create_transaction_builder()

# 2. Add location (with additional required fields)
location_data = {
    "street": "123 Main Street",
    "city": "Salt Lake City",
    "state": "UTAH",
    "zip": "84101",
    "county": "Salt Lake",      # REQUIRED
    "yearBuilt": 2020,         # REQUIRED
    "mlsNumber": "MLS123456"   # REQUIRED
}
client.transaction_builder.update_location_info(transaction_id, location_data)

# 3. Add price/date (with both commission objects)
price_data = {
    "dealType": "COMPENSATING",
    "propertyType": "RESIDENTIAL",
    "salePrice": {"amount": 550000, "currency": "USD"},
    "representationType": "BUYER",
    "listingCommission": {     # REQUIRED
        "commissionPercent": 3.0,
        "percentEnabled": True,
        "negativeOrEmpty": False
    },
    "saleCommission": {        # REQUIRED
        "commissionPercent": 3.0,
        "percentEnabled": True,
        "negativeOrEmpty": False
    }
}
client.transaction_builder.update_price_and_date_info(transaction_id, price_data)

# 4. Add participants
client.transaction_builder.add_buyer(transaction_id, {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Buyer",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "(801) 555-1234"
})

client.transaction_builder.add_seller(transaction_id, {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Seller", 
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "(801) 555-5678"
})

# 5. Add co-agents (working roles)
client.transaction_builder.add_co_agent(transaction_id, {
    "agentId": "bd465129-b224-43e3-b92f-524ea5f53783",
    "role": "REAL",
    "receivesInvoice": False
})

# Result: Complete working transaction with all components
```

This sequence has been tested and confirmed to work without errors.

## 🏢 Handling Multiple Teams & Offices

**Real-world scenario**: Many agents belong to multiple teams and offices. When creating transactions, you need to specify which team/office to use for the transaction.

### 🔍 Discovering Available Teams

Use `get_user_teams_and_offices()` to see all available options:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any
from rezen import RezenClient

client: RezenClient = RezenClient()

# Get user's available teams and offices
teams_info: Dict[str, Any] = client.transaction_builder.get_user_teams_and_offices()

print(f"Total teams: {teams_info['totalTeams']}")
print(f"Has multiple teams: {teams_info['hasMultipleTeams']}")
print(f"Default team: {teams_info['defaultTeam']}")

# List all available teams
for team in teams_info['teams']:
    print(f"Team: {team['teamName']}")
    print(f"  ID: {team['teamId']}")
    print(f"  Type: {team['teamType']}")
    print(f"  Roles: {team['roles']}")
```

### 🎯 Owner Agent Team Selection

You have **3 options** for setting owner agents:

=== "Option 1: Automatic (Default Team)"

    **Best for**: Users with single team or when default is acceptable
    
    ```python
    # Uses default team automatically
    result = client.transaction_builder.set_current_user_as_owner_agent(
        builder_id,
        role="BUYERS_AGENT"
    )
    
    # ⚠️ Warning will be shown if you have multiple teams
    ```

=== "Option 2: Explicit Team Selection"

    **Best for**: Users with multiple teams who need control
    
    ```python
    # First, discover available teams
    teams = client.transaction_builder.get_user_teams_and_offices()
    
    if teams["hasMultipleTeams"]:
        # Choose specific team (e.g., first team)
        selected_team_id = teams["teams"][0]["teamId"]
        
        # Set owner agent with explicit team
        result = client.transaction_builder.set_current_user_as_owner_agent_with_team(
            builder_id,
            role="BUYERS_AGENT",
            team_id=selected_team_id
        )
        
        print(f"✅ Used team: {teams['teams'][0]['teamName']}")
    else:
        # Use convenience method for single team
        result = client.transaction_builder.set_current_user_as_owner_agent(
            builder_id, role="BUYERS_AGENT"
        )
    ```

=== "Option 3: Interactive Selection"

    **Best for**: Applications with user interface
    
    ```python
    def choose_team_interactively() -> str:
        teams = client.transaction_builder.get_user_teams_and_offices()
        
        if not teams["hasMultipleTeams"]:
            return teams["defaultTeam"]
        
        print("Available teams:")
        for i, team in enumerate(teams["teams"]):
            print(f"  {i+1}. {team['teamName']} ({team['teamType']})")
        
        while True:
            try:
                choice = int(input("Select team (1-{}): ".format(len(teams["teams"]))))
                if 1 <= choice <= len(teams["teams"]):
                    return teams["teams"][choice-1]["teamId"]
            except ValueError:
                pass
            print("Invalid choice. Try again.")
    
    # Use interactive selection
    selected_team = choose_team_interactively()
    result = client.transaction_builder.set_current_user_as_owner_agent_with_team(
        builder_id,
        role="BUYERS_AGENT", 
        team_id=selected_team
    )
    ```

### 🛡️ Error Handling

Handle team-related errors gracefully:

```python
from rezen.exceptions import ValidationError

try:
    teams = client.transaction_builder.get_user_teams_and_offices()
    
    if teams["hasMultipleTeams"]:
        # User choice logic here...
        selected_team = "user-selected-team-id"
        
        result = client.transaction_builder.set_current_user_as_owner_agent_with_team(
            builder_id,
            role="BUYERS_AGENT",
            team_id=selected_team
        )
    else:
        result = client.transaction_builder.set_current_user_as_owner_agent(
            builder_id, role="BUYERS_AGENT"
        )
        
except ValidationError as e:
    if "not a member of team" in str(e):
        print("❌ Invalid team selected. Please choose from available teams.")
    elif "must belong to at least one team" in str(e):
        print("❌ User has no team memberships. Contact administrator.")
    else:
        print(f"❌ Validation error: {e}")
```

### 💡 Best Practices

!!! tip "Team Selection Guidelines"

    1. **Always check for multiple teams** before setting owner agents
    2. **Provide clear team information** to users (team name, type, roles)
    3. **Use default team logic** for convenience when appropriate  
    4. **Handle team validation errors** gracefully in production
    5. **Consider team types** - some teams may be for specific purposes

!!! warning "Office ID Requirements"

    Current implementation requires users to have an `officeId` in their profile. If team-specific offices become available in the API, this may need enhancement.
