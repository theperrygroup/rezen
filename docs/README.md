## 🚀 Quick Start Paths

### New to ReZEN API?
1. Start with **[Authentication & Setup](workflows/authentication.md)** to configure your environment
2. Try **[Teams](workflows/teams.md)** to find your team ID
3. Use **[Agents](workflows/agents.md)** to search for agent information
4. Follow **[Transaction Builder](workflows/transaction-builder.md)** to create your first transaction

### Building Production Applications?
1. Review **[Error Handling](workflows/error-handling.md)** for robust applications
2. Implement **[Testing](workflows/testing.md)** for reliable code
3. Use **[Transaction Management](workflows/transactions.md)** for live transaction operations

### Integration Developer?
1. **[Transaction Builder](workflows/transaction-builder.md)** - Core transaction creation
2. **[Agents](workflows/agents.md)** - Agent discovery and network management
3. **[Teams](workflows/teams.md)** - Team assignment for agents
4. **[Error Handling](workflows/error-handling.md)** - Production-ready error handling
